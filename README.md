# 🎸 StrumAI

StrumAI is an AI-powered tool that listens to short guitar audio clips and predicts the chords (or tabs) being played. The goal is to help musicians, learners, and creators identify and play along with chords using intelligent machine learning and deep learning models.

## 🔍 Goal

To build a system that can:
- Take a short `.wav` file of guitar audio (recorded or uploaded)
- Analyze and identify the chord(s) played
- Eventually display the chord or tablature on a user-friendly interface (web/app)

## 🧠 Tech Stack (Planned)

- Python
- Librosa (audio processing)
- JAMS (annotation handling)
- Scikit-learn / PyTorch (for ML & DL models)
- Streamlit or Flask + React (for UI, later)
